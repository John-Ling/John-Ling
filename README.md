Hi!
I'm John.
I'm a self-taught Python and C# developer.
I started programming in September of 2019 and continued during 2020-21 (thanks worldwide pandemic)
While most of my work is at the computer, I work with electronics, CAD and 3D printing to add more to my projects.
I build whatever I want whenever I want. Anything that interests me!
Currently looking into web dev.
